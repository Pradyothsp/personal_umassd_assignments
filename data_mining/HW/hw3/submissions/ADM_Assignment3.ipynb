       "'                THE HOLE THAT WAS TOO NARROW\\n\\n   Once upon a time. . . a stoat was so greedy that he would eat anything that\\ncame his way. But he was punished for his greed. He found some old stale eggs\\nin a barn and, as usual, gobbled the lot. However, he soon started to feel\\nagonizing pains in his tummy, his eyes grew dim and he broke out in a cold \\nsweat. For days, he lay between life and death, then the fever dropped. The\\nfirst time he dared climb a tree to rob a nest, thin and weak with his \\ntrousers dangling over an empty stomach, he became dizzy and fell. That is how\\nhe twisted his ankle. Sick with hunger, he limped about in search of food, but\\nthat made him feel even hungrier than before. Then good luck came his way.\\nAlthough wary of venturing too close to human habitations, he was so hungry he\\nwent up to a tavern on the outskirts of the village. The air was full of \\nlovely smells and the poor stoat felt his mouth watering as he pictured all \\nthe nice things inslde. An inviting smell coming from a crack in the wall \\nseemed to be stronger than the others. Thrusting his nose into the crack, he \\nwas greeted by a waft of delicious scents. The stoat frantically clawed at the\\ncrack with his paws and teeth, trying to widen it. Slowly the plaster between \\nthe blocks of rubble began to crumble, till all he had to do was move a stone.\\nShoving with all his might, the stoat made a hole. And then a really wonderful\\nsight met his gaze. He was inside the pantry, where hams, salamis, cheeses, \\nhoney, jam and nuts were stored. Overwhelmed by it all, the stoat could not \\nmake up his mind what to taste first. He jumped from one thing to another, \\nmunching all the time, till his tummy was full. Satisfied at last, he fell \\nasleep. Then he woke again, had another feast and went back to sleep. With all\\nthis food, his strength returned, and next day, the stoat was strong enough to\\nclimb up to the topmost shelves and select the tastiest delicacies. By this \\ntime, he was just having a nibble here and a nibble there. But he never \\nstopped eating: he went on and on and on. By now, he was very full indeed, as \\nhe chattered to himself: \"Salami for starters . . . no, the ham\\'s better! Some\\nsoft cheese and a spot of mature cheese as well . . . I think I\\'ll have a \\npickled sausage too . . .\"\\n   In only a few days, the stoat had become very fat and his trouser button \\nhad popped off over a bulging tummy. But of course, the stoat\\'s fantastic luck\\ncould not last for ever.  \\n   One afternoon, the stoat froze in mid-munch at the creak of a door. Heavy \\nfootsteps thumped down the stairs, and the stoat looked helplessly round. Fear\\nof discovery sent him hunting for a way to escape. He ran towards the hole in \\nthe wall through which he had come. But though his head and shoulders entered \\nthe hole, his tummy, which had grown much larger since the day he had come in,\\nslmply would not pass. The stoat was in a dangerous position: he was stuck! \\nTwo thick hands grabbed him by the tail.\\n   \"You horrid little robber! So you thought you\\'d get away, did you? I\\'ll \\nsoon deal with you!\" \\n   Strange though it may sound, the only thought in the greedy stoat\\'s head \\nwas a longing to be starving of hunger again . . .\\n'"

fair mean and by foul many maiden they would lay then prove it all by boasting in very manly way bain went into town now and found likely inn he wa sure the maid would swoon a soon a they saw him he preened and pranced and pampered to show his better side and practiced his sincerity to hide the fact he lied and sure enough the spell he wove had all the lady there dying for the chance to run their finger through his hair please lady take number pretty bain he then did say for will serve you all upstairs until the break of day so bain think he stud now and many maid agree he care not for discretion in fact he charged fee all the lady they were waiting to take their turn in bed then boast to one another im his only love they said but magnus think he clever of that he is so sure he followed bain to see how he would all the lady lure he saw lady that he knew whose jealous husband cruel would kill to keep his lovely wife a miser keep jewel so straight away he went to tell this jealous hulking man of just what bain wa going to do and his wife part in the plan and so he thought he could be sure to win their manly bet this surely wa a clever a any man could get now magnus he is lazy a if you didnt know he thought he had it made now and wished to see the show so he went into the tavern and waited for to see very jealous husband and his victim soontobe upstairs bain wa grooming he made the lady wait while magnus tried his best to hide and leave bain to his fate soon the jealous husband had gathered to his side a many friend a he could find to help him take his bride but magnus wa impatient and quite horny now a well so he slipped out through the back to stable by their smell he wa sure that he could ream some very lonely horse then be back inside in time to see bain thrashed by manly force but even for old magnus thing sometimes work out well for bain chose for his first lay the faithless wife from hell she could not wait for foreplay but jumped upon his steed and started quick to ride him to service her deep need know now what youre thinking how typical it seems for bain to end up with maid while magnus horse ream but justice it soon entered into this merry tune the husband and his many friend had come and none too soon up the stair they charged a one and burst into the room then looked bain and saw right there his own impending doom and naked a jaybird he took his only chance went leaping out the window without even his pant now bain had not yet finished his very manly chore his manhood still wa rigid and hard now to ignore but his luck did not desert him for below him now he saw thatched roof coming quickly made of soft and yielding straw and magnus in the stable had found horse to pork wa pounding deep into her tail and leaned into his work when crashing through the rooftop came bain with his stiff spear and found poor magnus most exposed and fell into his rear mighty squeal of pain and glee wa heard for mile around and far away some pig got hard just thinking of that sound and so we have sandwich of two men and horse it hard now to imagine how thing could turn out worse and bain who wa stuck deep now wa trying to escape but magnus had recovered and started screaming rape out came the jealous husband who could not believe his eye followed closely by the lady who laughed until they cried now if man were able to die of shame alone then surely now our hero would be deader than stone but ala in their position an embarrassment from hell they could not defend themselves and their fate now will tell they were taken to the wood and then tied upside down their clothes were burned before their eye and all went back to town you think the story over but there one more thing to see who had won the wager and the greatest prick would be for a they were ahanging an argument ensued bain said im the winner and still the coolest dude but magnus he retorted at least finished mine so shut up bain you loser hate it when you whine shindar drinking song last night went out drinking and met lively crew so we wandered off together to hoist an ale or two we came upon little place where the lady were most fair and so we all decided that we should tarry there oh were bold and handsome bastard til the morning anyway when the rising sun will smite our eye and make u curse the day the lass they all love u for a long a we can pay but when our coin run out they will send u on our way so well hoist another ale and well sing another song and well crawl from bar to bar until the coming of the dawn behind the bar with golden hair there stood beautious lass with ruby lip and eye of blue and this exquisite nose well maddog wa foolish lad whose mood did not soon pas he lept across that little bar and tried to pinch her nose chorus we grabbed young maddog by the cloak and everything wa fine until the lass lad showed up with friend or nine will not bore you with the tale suffice to say we had them beat and then the city watch showed up to make the night complete chorus now fezzik he wa not to bright hed smashed guardsman head so the magistrate said take him out and hang him til he dead the lass that maddog tried to pinch appealed to the bench and this morning ive been told he got married to the wench chorus his honor looked me in the eye and said what should do so looked right back at him said let hoist an ale or two so off we wandered into town with guard or two hed brung along the way there wa brawl and come the morning he wa hung final chorus jester of the shindar one thousand, nine hundred and
